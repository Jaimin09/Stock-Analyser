# Stock-Buddy

Stock Buddy determines if the company stock is worth buying or not. It generates a score for the company's stock to determine how good the stock is for investement

Problem : There are millions of companies in the stock market. How to determine which are the good companies to invest in? If you end up investing in a poor performing company, then its more likely that you are just going to lose your money. That's why investing in the stock market is risky if you don't analyse the company you are investing in.

But analysing the company is only an expert's cup of tea! That's why Stock Buddy has made it simple. All the expert knowledge combined with the algorithmic capabilities, the Stock Buddy analyse the company for normal investors who don't have much knowledge on stock marketing. All they need to do is, just pass the stock url from moneycontrol.com and get the score showing if the company is good for investment or not.

No need to study all those scary numbers on the balance sheet of the company. No need to have expert knowledge to find good companies to invest in. No need to spend alot of time studying a poor performing company. Just enter the url and hit the button. Everything is done for you !


Hurdles I face : The biggest challenge was to generate the formula/algorithm to determine the score, from the balance sheet info. I needed to come up with a single number from jargons of data. I overcome it by analysis which parameters plays the biggest role in determining whether the company is good performing or not. After finding the parameters, I figured out how those will be used in generaing the score. And then I tested those parameters, to see how much impact they have on the accurate analysis of the score. I discarded some non impacting or misleading parameters and keep the ones that are useful. 

The parameters used for the analysis has been taken from the advice from the stock investing expert and learning some other materials for good investment.
